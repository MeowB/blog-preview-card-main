## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- Flexbox

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on the front-end part of development, using more flexbox and even if i'm getting more and more comfortable with css, i still get stuck sometimes and have to dig for information.

### Useful resources

- [Chatgpt](https://chat.openai.com/) - This helped me as a quick question helper, i used it to ask layout questions and to talk about my project when i get stuck.
- [Flexbox cheet sheet](https://flexbox.malven.co/) - This helped me remember how to use flexbox for the name part, i used it to center vertically the content and have the image on the same line as the h2
